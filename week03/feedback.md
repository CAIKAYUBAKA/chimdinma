# Week 3 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 5/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* **(-2) Your test code failed to run for some reason.  I ran your multiple choice and found 4 responses to be incorrect. In the future, please work on these until you get them all correct.**

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* Some code did not follow the instructions
  * **(-1) 14.3 seems to be written to pass the tests I provided, but did not follow the instructions on the website.  You have to code the requirements, not just the asserts**
  * **(-1) 14.4 was not completed.**
  * **(-1) 14.5 did not implement all the possible scenarios defined in the website.**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?

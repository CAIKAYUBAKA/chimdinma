# Week 2 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 8/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* **All good.**

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* **(-1) You've got some bad indenting in 5.2 with your function definitions. It looks like this code should not have worked. Did you test it?**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **Be careful with variable names. For example in 5.6, you have height_cm... but the height being used is in meters, not centimeters.**
  * **(-1) Similarly, these calculations are not BMI, they are BMR - basal metabolic rate**
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?

* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**

**(-1) Variable names like `df` and `data` and `merged_df` don't help the reader understand what you're doing and what those variables represent.**

**(-2) You did two concatenations but no real joins of your data.  And the concat you did on age doesn't really make sense.**

**I love the 2d KDE plot!!**

**Overall, I think you did a solid job.  It would have been very helpful if you'd used variable names that were easier to read and understand.  It would have also been very good to have a few more comments throughout your code.  Not too bad, though. (-1)**

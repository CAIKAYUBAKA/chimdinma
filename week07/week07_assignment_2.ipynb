That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

I had to learn doing this, i spent 2-3 hours everyday learning python and i havenâ€™t become perfect yet, still learning but my progress was tested during the quiz and i had a whooping 19 points out of 20 , week 4 was 9/10 and that became the happiest week ever for me."
